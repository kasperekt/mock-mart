# Mock Mart

A mock e-commerce platform built with Next.js, Drizzle ORM (MySQL), and Shadcn/ui. Designed for functional testing and development with mocked data.

---

## üìù Environment Setup

Before running the app, create a `.env` file in the project root with your database credentials and any other required environment variables. Example:

```env
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=mockmart
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password
DB_URL=mysql://${MYSQL_USER}:${MYSQL_PASSWORD}@db:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE}
```

- Make sure these values match your local or Docker MySQL setup.
- The app and Drizzle ORM will use these credentials to connect to the database.

---

## üöÄ Running the App

### 1. Using Docker (Recommended)

This will start both the Next.js app and a MySQL database.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- Database credentials are loaded from your `.env` file.
- Drizzle migrations are run automatically on startup.

### 2. Local Development (without Docker)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start MySQL** (ensure credentials match your `.env`):
   - You can use a local MySQL instance or Docker.
3. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit migrate
   ```
4. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üóÑÔ∏è Database & Migrations

- All database credentials are managed via `.env`.
- Database schema is defined in `src/db/schema.ts`.
- To generate a new migration after schema changes:
  ```bash
  npx drizzle-kit generate
  ```
- Migrations are stored in the `drizzle/migrations/` directory.

## ü§ù Contributing

- Update `src/db/schema.ts` before generating new migrations.
- Ensure all new/removed columns are reflected in migrations.
- Use Playwright for functional testing.
