- You create code designed for next.js
- You use Shadcn/ui (https://ui.shadcn.com/) as the UI Component library

## Database
- Always connect to database using credentials from .env file
- This project uses Drizzle ORM library for handlign database queries, migrations and entirety of databases
- This project uses MySQL database, operated by Drizzle ORM
- Each time that new columns is added or a column is removed, there should be new migration generated for the Drizzle ORM
- Make sure that when used foreign keys, types of columns match each other.
- Before each migration happens, [schema.ts](mdc:src/db/schema.ts) file must be updated
- New migrations are generated using `npx drizzle-kit generate` command
